MATLAB combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis and
design processes with a programming language that expresses matrix and
array mathematics directly.

MATLAB is intended to be used on the compute nodes within PBS job
scripts.  Use on the login nodes should be restricted to setting
preferences, accessing help, and launching Parallel Server jobs.  It is
recommended that MATLAB is used without a GUI on the compute nodes, as
the interactive response is slow.

The license for this installation of MATLAB provides an unlimited number of
workers via MATLAB Parallel Server.

MATLAB will normally use up to the total number of cores on a node for
multi-threaded operations (e.g. matrix inversions) and for parallel
computations.  It also makes no restriction on its memory use.  These
features are incompatible with the shared use of nodes on Cirrus.

More information on using the local cluster, MATLAB Parallel Server, and GPUs
is available in the Cirrus documentation
